Program 01 and 02:

For the code snippet given in the reference code (sequential function) in the program, the objective is to optimize the code using loop transformations and then further improve the execution time using intrinsics.

Program 03: 

For the code snippet given in the reference code (sequential function) in the program, the objective is to further improve the execution time using OpenMP parallelism. The given code is kind of a column-wise prefix sum.
